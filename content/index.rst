            *I'm Jeremiah Igrami, a writer in a tech odyssey. This is my little piece of the Web.* 
            

             

            I'm embedded in the world of computer programming. 
            I love the life, the community, the culture, the folklore, the jargon.

            I made this site to share with you my discoveries and adventures in 
            programming, software development, and everything that makes a 
            computer tick. 
        
            Read the full gist `about me <{filename}/about.rst>`_. 

            Or read some of my screeds on the Articles page.
