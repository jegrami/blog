:summary: This is my first post as a writer in the world of programming.



Hi! I’m Jeremiah, a writer and copyeditor transitioning to tech. I started learning
to code in Python a few weeks ago. And frankly, so far, I've been nothing short
of amazed and excited. The only regret I have is not having started sooner!

But as the coding proverb (a corollary of the Chinese proverb) goes, 

 The best time to learn how to code was six months ago --- the next best time 
 is now

I'm thrilled by what I'm learning, the cool things I can make a computer do, and
and the numerous doors of opportunity that a mastery of this skill could open for me.


What I'm most excited about
=============================

And here is what I’m most excited about. I’ve always been a strong advocate of
accessibility --- ever since I came across the concept in a UX design article 
I read last year. I believe everyone deserves access to technologies and devices 
that enhance everyday life. And developers must design and build products and
applications with disabled people in mind. With software development skills, 
I can contribute actively to the Accessibility Project. I can build software that 
makes life easy for disabled people.

As I grind through my Python lessons, I’m excited to share with you what I learn.
Documenting my learning journey through blogging is an excellent way to solidify my 
understanding of technical materials and share my knowledge with others.

As a beginner, it’s hard to decide where to start. But I realized that the first 
step is to get excited about what you're learning and understand why you're doing it.
For me, learning how to build software will open doors to new opportunities in the 
tech industry; more important, it will enable me achieve part of my dream, which is 
building software for people with disabilities.

Why I chose python
====================

First, I dread math. It’s why I even chose writing in the first place: 
to avoid having to deal with calculations. As a writer and copyeditor, 
I find words much more interesting than numbers. And I thought coding was all 
about numbers and complex arithmetic. But it isn’t—thank God!

In fact, one of the things that drew me to Python was its simplicity and readability.
Python's syntax is easy to grasp, which makes it an excellent language for beginners
with no computer science background. And while there's certainly some basic math 
involved in programming, it's not as intimidating as I thought it would be.

Also, Python is a versatile, high-level, fast-growing programming language used 
in a wide variety of applications, from web development to data science to machine 
learning. I'm eager to learn Python and become an expert programmer. I know that it
won't happen overnight, but I'm excited about the journey ahead.


What to expect from me
=======================

So what can you expect from my upcoming articles here? 
Well, for starters, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn. I'll share 
my triumphs and my struggles and, hopefully, offer some helpful insights for other
beginners along the way.

I'll also write about the use of Python in the real world, from building websites
to analyzing data. And most important, I'll be sharing my passion for programming 
and writing. I believe that the two disciplines are closely intertwined, 
and I'm excited to explore how they can complement each other.

I'm thrilled to be starting this journey and sharing it with you. 
Whether a beginner or an expert programmer, I want to connect with you!
Let's learn together, collaborate, and make great software!
