:summary: Part two of my article on starting my journey in programming.


My fascination for science, computing, and the limitless power of technology began 
the first day I saw Professor Steven Hawkins on TV. (Might talk about this in a 
separate article.) Before that, I had read his book “A Brief History of Time,” 
first published in 1988. And, like pretty much everyone else, I fell in love 
with the man, admiring his genius. With simple, clear, and engaging writing, prof. 
Hawking demystifies black holes, the Big Bang, and the nature of time itself. 
The book left me in awe of, and curious about, the universe. I wanted to know more.
The man took what was supposed to be a dry and boring subject and made it fun and 
enjoyable. It got me wondering. Would I have loved math (and 
therefore be good at it) if had a teacher like prof? Or I'm I just a hopeless
innumerate whose brain is not built to understand numbers? Well, I guess we'll
never know now. 

Among other things, Professor Hawkins made me realize that no subject --- not even 
cosmology! --- is beyond my ability to comprehend. Today, I’m learning what in 
my wildest imagination I never thought I would: software development, computer 
programming.

There's so much potential in technology to improve people's lives, and I’m joining 
the industry to explore that potential.

I’m a writer and copyeditor fascinated by computers and the impact technology 
has on our everyday lives. I believe that everyone --- disabled or not, rich or
poor, in the Global North or South --- deserves access to the technology they need
to live a fulfilling life. With open source and accessibility, we can break 
down all the barriers to the use of technology and build a more inclusive society.

I’m excited to start on this path to becoming a professional software developer 
solving real-world problems with code and feeling like some magician. I’m committed
to implementing accessibility best practices in the software applications I build. 
I’m committed to contributing to open-source projects.

Open source is all about collaboration and community, and it's amazing to see how
many people are working together to create solutions that benefit everyone. 
Being a part of that community and contributing my own code is something I'm 
really looking forward to.

The tech community is truly incredible. It's so welcoming and supportive. 
I’ve learned a lot about software development --- 
careers, useful tools, networking, interview tips, coding tips, etc--- in just a 
few weeks of hanging around Tech Twitter.

If it weren’t for you, geeks, I would be utterly confused and probably 
discomfited by the slew of tools and learning resources online 
(trust me, it can be frustrating for a beginner).

But by following a lot of devs on Twitter and taking careful note of their 
recommendations and advice, I have a clear roadmap to becoming a practiced 
software developer (with solid projects in my portfolio). I have knowledge of, 
and access to, the best tools and resources for reaching my goal.

Deciding to learn coding and become a software developer is one of the best 
decisions I've ever made. Contributing to open-source projects and using technology
to improve accessibility are a couple of the ways I hope to make a positive impact 
with my skills. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me, and I'm excited
to share it with others along the way.
