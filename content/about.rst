:slug: about


I'm a technical writer who loves programming. 

Before I became a writer, I was a copyeditor for an online calendar that 
publishes serious and fun holidays both in the U.S. and worldwide. 
Currently, I work as a staff writer for an electric vehicle startup in Abuja, 
Nigeria. 

I have written stakeholder engagement reports, concept notes, 
summaries of policy documents, and newsletters for the 
Nigerian Energy Transition Working Group.


My current interest is in technology and computing, technical communication 
and documentation. I enjoy learning and writing about programming in Python, 
data engineering, API documentation, and software development in general. 

Technical writing allows me to apply my passion for technology,
learning, and helping others learn. 

This site is primarily about documenting my journey of learning and writing about
the topics I love. I hope you find something useful and interesting here!
