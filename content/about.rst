:slug: about


I'm a writer who loves programming. 

Before I became a writer, I was a copyeditor for an online calendar that 
publishes serious and fun holidays both in the U.S. and worldwide. 
I'm currently a staff writer for an electric vehicle startup in Nigeria, regularly
publishing articles on EV adoption on the company's  blog and external 
media platforms.  

I have written stakeholder engagement reports, concept notes, 
summaries of policy documents, and newsletters for the 
Nigerian Energy Transition Working Group.

I'm also an AI Tutor (Writer) for Mindrift, a platform where domain experts, 
writers, and editors generate content used for developing LLMs. 
My role includes writing, refining, and evaluating prompts and responses to 
improve the performance of AI models in everyday tasks. My work at Mindrift
has been used by companies such as Samsung, JetBrains, Naver Labs, Replika,
and AliExpress. More important, I have had the opportunity to not only 
look behind the curtain to see how training data for AI is generated but 
also participate in the process! 


I started my career as a business writer and copyeditor, but I've since discovered
that writing computer programs and technical documentation is what I want to do
with my life. I enjoy learning and writing about 
software development tools, Python programming, data engineering, the internet,
and some interesting tech arcana. 

Source code, debuggers, operating systems, firmware, compilers, assemblers, 
virtual machines, bootloaders, algorithms & data structures, 
large language models, parsers, transformers. What's not to love?  
You can describe me as a writer and tech enthusiast committed
to exploring the very depths of technology and software. 



This is where I document my journey of learning,  
building, and writing about software. My hope for this site is that, 
from time to time, a programmer will stumble upon a useful bit of insight 
here that helps them find and squash an elusive bug.

More about me and the things I love
-------------------------------------

I love words, people, and music. Before I became a writer, I actually wanted to be 
a rapper. (I used to freestyle on stage back in uni.) 

I love to read books about programming, computer history, English grammar,
and psychology. I enjoy a fair share of epic, military, and sci-fi movies. 
And I love listening to kickass engineers talk nerdy tech stuff. 

Writing allows me to expend my passion for technology,
learning, and helping others learn.
